* Quick Overview

Go testing is built in

`testing` package and `go` `test` command

.code code_test.go /^func TestStringIndex/,/^}/

  $ go test
  --- FAIL: TestStringIndex (0.00s)
  	code_test.go:12: Index("chicken","ken") = 4; want 5
  FAIL
  exit status 1
  FAIL	github.com/paultyng/talk-go-integration-testing	0.001s

: convention for naming files and functions
: whitebox and blackbox testing
: includes benchmarking and examples as well
: coverage is also built-in (which applies to integration tests as well)
: no need to use an external library, although we commonly do for assertions

* What are Integration Tests?

- Show how major parts of the system work together
- Test communication paths between different pieces
- ie. application code and data persistence (database, queue, etc.)

: everyone defines differently, like devops
: add image for our integration test framework

* Run different sets of tests for different situations

: many different ways to run subsets of tests in go

* Build flags

At the file level:

.code tags.go /^\/\//

Can be used in testing, but also building / running:

  $ go test -tags integration
  $ go build -tags integration

: go tries to use the same build flags for their standard library tools

* Short flag

  -short
    Tell long-running tests to shorten their run time.
    It is off by default but set during all.bash so that installing
    the Go tree can run a sanity check but not spend time running
    exhaustive tests.

Use with `go` `test`:

  $ go test -short

.code code_test.go /^func TestLongRunning/,/^}/

* Regex name matching

  -run regexp
    Run only those tests and examples matching the regular expression.
    For tests the regular expression is split into smaller ones by
    top-level '/', where each must match the corresponding part of a
    test's identifier.

: used by tools like vim-go and vscode already

  $ go test -run 'TestLongRunning'

* Parallelization

: packages run in parallel by default

`t.Parallel()`

* Race Detection

  $ go test -race

We've been stung by this but the flag found it:

: race in Echo with JWT deserialization, the built in Go race detection found it
: trust the race detector!

* Preventing races with parallel tests

`sync.Once`

.play sync_once.go /startslide/,/endslide/

* External Dependencies

* dockertest package

.link https://github.com/ory/dockertest

Setup a pool, start `mysql:5.7`:

.code dockertest.go /startslide1/,/endslide1/

: `latest` vs version locking

* dockertest package

Backoff / health checks: 

.code dockertest.go /startslide2/,/endslide2/

: similar to ua-ci, but usable via native go tooling

* dockertest package

Run your tests now against that db:

.code dockertest.go /startslide3/,/endslide3/

.code dockertest.go /startslide4/,/endslide4/

* Debugging

- vscode
- delve

: demo
